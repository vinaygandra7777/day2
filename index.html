        <p>Dressing for cold weather is easy. Footwear choices are limitless, textures are plentiful, and the possibility of layering provides an additional sartorial dimension.

            Summer dressing, on the other hand, can present more of a challenge. The rising mercury brings with it many great things – barbecues, beer gardens and bronzed skin to name a few – but it also means that wardrobe options diminish significantly.
            
            Staying cool is concern number one, but looking good is a close second. Thankfully there are a few tried-and-tested warm-weather outfits that manage to tick both boxes. Master these go-to, seasonal getups and you need never fall into a summer style rut again.
            
            From tackling the office in heatwave conditions to picking the perfect wedding guest attire – here we present Ape’s ultimate summer outfit hitlist.</p>

        <p><strong>Suits ain’t what they used to be, and that’s a good thing. Dressing down, working from home, 
           comfort-seeking and bolder styles have upended what it means to wear a suit. With Savile Row on its uppers,
           traditionalism in suiting still works for wedding days and funerals. And accountants. For everything else, it’s time to welcome in some new ideas.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>“The modern gentleman is not the final stage in Darwin’s evolutionary process. A true gentleman should always be looking to enrich himself further through experience, self-improvement and the enjoyment of quality, whilst keeping an eye on value. And perhaps most importantly, we must remember that a true gentleman is one who puts more into the world than he takes out.”</strong></p></aside>

        <p><strong>The polo shirt occupies a unique space in the modern man’s wardrobe. It’s not as casual as a T-shirt, nor is it as smart as a shirt. It bridges the gap between those two extremes, ensuring you have something to throw on when the dress code is neither here nor there. What’s more, it can be dressed up or down with ease, making it extremely versatile and a valuable tool for building lots of different types of outfits.</strong></p></aside>

            <summary><strong>What are the Types of fashion ?</strong></summary>
            <p><mark>1. Sporty:</mark> Sporty style, also known as athleisure, takes elements of athletic wear, like leggings, bike shorts, and oversize sweatshirts, out of the gym and onto the streets.<br>
                <mark>2. Bohemian:</mark> Also known as “boho” or “boho chic,” bohemian style borrows from the 1960’s hippie aesthetic and festival culture. The style incorporates earth tones, natural fabrics and dyes, and prints and accessories from around the world. The hallmarks of boho style are flowing maxi dresses, long skirts, bell-bottom pants, large brimmed hats, fringe, suede, and slouchy handbags.<br>
                <mark>3. Grunge:</mark> Inspired by grunge music and the subculture that originated in the ’80s and ’90s Seattle, grunge fashion features thrift-store finds like plaid flannel shirts, oversize knits, and feminine dresses styled in a subversive, disheveled way. Grunge looks often include ripped jeans or tights, unkempt hairstyles, and black boots.<br>
                <mark>4. Preppy:</mark> Preppy style is inspired by the clothing and uniforms traditionally worn at private East Coast prep schools and Ivy League colleges. Preppy style often takes inspiration from upper-class sports like polo, sailing, tennis, and horseback riding. Preps are known for wearing polo shirts, Oxford shirts, argyle sweaters and socks, cloth-wrapped headbands, boat shoes, blazers, pearls, cardigans, and khaki pants.</p>

        <p>We wouldn’t advise following fashion trends. In fact, we pride ourselves on doing the exact opposite. But, if you’re looking to inject a bit of freshness into your wardrobe, or want to spice up your everyday staples, it is worth paying attention to what’s going on in the often confusing world of clothing.

        This isn’t a list of disposable, flash-in-the-pan trends. Rather, we’ve decided to focus on the future classics that just so happen to be having their time in the spotlight right now. These are the trending pieces we’d wear ourselves – they’re easy to incorporate into your existing rotation and will remain stylish for years to come.
            
        From the return of military style to the continued relaxing of silhouettes, these are this year’s most wearable men’s fashion trends.</p>
